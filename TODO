v1.3:
 - Wide char support in sdir
   - Console needs a cache of gdi metrics per font for this, looks insane
 - General MSFIX review
 - Explicit Ctrl+C by detecting console process before launch, if not console
   process on same console don't use GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent
 - Libwin checkbox
 - Libwin menubar
 - Libwin multiline edit
 - Libdlg file selection
 - Libdlg directory selection

To consider:
 - Use CopyFileEx when compressing to eliminate CreateFile?
 - Colorize help and error text
 - Ctrl+R
 - More select should use logical line coordinates rather than conhost
   buffer coordinates to allow selection beyond screen size

v2.0:
 - Port pcre
 - Use regex in hilite
 - Case statement in ys
 - Ctrl+Z
 - Markdown formatter/parser
 - Man or something like it
