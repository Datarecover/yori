Ways to improve on NMAKE:
- Allow inference rules to specify dependencies
- Enhance preprocessor CreateProcess capabilities so cmd/find/redirects
  aren't necessary to answer simple questions
- Cache results of preprocessor children so find can execute multiple times
  per child process for different things
- Find a way to execute preprocessor CreateProcess calls in parallel
- More internal parsing of commands, esp. to allow basic if commands in-proc
  (for clean)
- A dependency-aware way to describe install, so $(BINDIR)\foo.exe: foo.exe,
  and it's only copied if the source has changed.  The challenge is that this
  is for a list of targets
- Heuristic search for targets ("ymake yedit")
